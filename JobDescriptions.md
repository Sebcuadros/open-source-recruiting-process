### Job Descriptions

At Whop, we want to ensure our job descriptions give you a clear picture of the role for which youâ€™re applying. Goals of our job descriptions:

1. Insight into the primary responsibilities of the role and the team with which you would be working.
2. Give you an understanding of the core experience required to be successful in the role.
3. Insight into the nice to haves that though not core requirements would make a candidate stand out.
4. Set clear expectations for your first 30, 60 and 90 days.
5. Provide clarity on what this hire is accomplishing for Whop.
