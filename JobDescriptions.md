### Job Descriptions

At Whop, we want to ensure our job descriptions give you a clear picture of the role for which youâ€™re applying. Goals of our job descriptions:

1. Insight into the primary responsibilities of the role and the team with which you would be working.
2. Give you an understanding of the experience you need to be successful in the role. 
3. Set clear expectations for your first three months.

While we may use specific job titles on our jobs page to help candidates find our open positions, internally, we standardize job titles to drive equality between people in a specific job function. For example, no matter whether you are an engineer working on our core, SQL, or admin UI engineering teams, your internal job title will be Member of Technical Staff. This system also allows our employees to focus more on what they need to do to achieve company, team, and personal goals, rather than focusing on what they need to do to get to the next job title.
